# Python Hands-On Tasks for DevOps Beginners  

## 1. System Monitoring Script  
📌 **Task:** Use Python’s `psutil` library to display CPU and memory usage.  
✅ **Instructions:**  
- Install `psutil` using `pip install psutil`.  
- Write a script that prints CPU and memory usage every few seconds.  
- Example output:  
CPU Usage: 35% Memory Usage: 60%

- **Bonus:** Extend the script to log this data into a file for future analysis.

## 2. API Interaction (Weather Data Fetching)  
📌 **Task:** Write a Python script that fetches weather data from an API and processes the response.  
✅ **Instructions:**  
- Sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up) and get a free API key.  
- Install `requests` using `pip install requests`.  
- Fetch weather details (temperature, weather condition, humidity) for a given city.  
- Example output:  
Weather in Lagos: 
Temperature: 30°C 
Condition: Clear sky 
Humidity: 75%
